## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
if(!require(pacman)) install.packages(pacman)
pacman::p_load(reactable, tidyverse, plotly)

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
reactable(infert)
ggplot(infert, aes(x = education, fill= education ))+
  geom_bar()
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
