## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse, ploty)
entities<-c("Albania", "Germany", "Latvia", "Mexico", "Morocco","Zimbabwe", "Zambia", "South Africa")
Happy<- read_csv("C:/Users/lenovo/Downloads/share-of-people-who-say-they-are-happy.csv") %>% 
  rename(happiness=`Happiness: Happy (aggregate)`) %>%  
  filter(Entity %in% entities)

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(Happy, aes(x = Year, y = happiness, color = Entity)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5, linetype = "solid") +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
